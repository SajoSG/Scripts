Scripts

A repository of useful scripts

This a bunch of scripts that i have found useful during the course of my work.
Some are opensource and/or downloaded from the internet. I may have tweaked the scripts a little bit to suit my needs.

The documentation may be insufficient though i try to make the code as readable as possible.
